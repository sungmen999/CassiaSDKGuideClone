# Overview
This wiki shows developers how to use the Cassia RESTful API to integrate their
Bluetooth devices with the Cassia IoT Access Controller (AC) and the Cassia Bluetooth
routers.

The Cassia Bluetooth Router is the worldâ€™s first long-range Bluetooth router designed for
enterprise deployments, enabling seamless coverage of any size and scale. It extends
Bluetooth range up to 1,000 feet (open space, line-of-sight), and enables remote control of
multiple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices without requiring any changes to the Bluetooth
devices.
