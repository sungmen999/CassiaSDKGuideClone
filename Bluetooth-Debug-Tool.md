We integrated Cassia the RESTful API into a Bluetooth debug tool with a visual interface. After a
RESTful API call, the debug tool will show the response messages. It will help developers to
integrate business applications and Bluetooth devices with the Cassia Bluetooth router and
AC. This tool is available at: [http://www.bluetooth.tech/nativeHubControl/index.html](http://www.bluetooth.tech/nativeHubControl/index.html)

**API Info**: This area contains the user's most commonly used commands. When you click on
the buttons, the parameters and descriptions related to that command will pop up.

**Scan List**: When turning on this option, the Cassia router will start scanning for all BLE devices within its range. The BLE devices need to be in broadcast mode. You can connect to
one or multiple devices.

**Device and Services List**: Turn on this option to see the connected devices. Based on the
deviceâ€™s Bluetooth profile, you can write value or turn on the notifications.

**Notify List**: If you have turned on the notification of the correct handle, you will see a stream
of raw data flowing in the Notify List window.
