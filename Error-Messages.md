**NOTE**: For Connect and Pair APIs, avoid calling a new API before the previous API call has finished, otherwise the router will respond with a “chip is busy” error.

For HTTP 500 error, the following are the common error codes:

| Message | Description |
| ---------- |------------------|
| `parameter invalid` | Reason: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) chipId invalid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) MAC address format is invalid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) length of the data to be read or written is invalid, such as reaching length limitation or in odd-length.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) length of key for pair-input is invalid. for example, expect 0/1 for confirmation, but input is 6 digits.<br>Checks:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) chipId can only be 0, 1 or all for firmware version >=2.1.1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) MAC address format includes :, for example CC:1B:E0:E0:01:02<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) For advertising data,  data is Hex String in write handle request, and the length should be even.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) passkey length in pair-input could be the followings, 1--confirm，6--passkey input，32--legacy oob. It should be consistence with pair return value. |
| `device not found`   | Reason: Device is not connected with gateway when a GATT (read/write) request is sent, or getting RSSI for BLE Connection.<br>Checks:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The device is already connected and no disconnect events (timeout or device disconnect) is recevied in connection state SSE.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Try to reconnect the device in case of receiving this error. |
| `memory alloc error` | When the Bluetooth chip does not have enough memory to complete the operation it will return this error. |
| `operation timeout` | Each operation has a time-out value, especially those timeconsuming operations, such as connection. When connecting to a device that does not exist, the operation will timeout after the 20s. |
| `chip is not ready` | This error will be reported when sending commands to the chip fails. |
| `chip is busy` | Reason: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Multiple connection requests are received by gateway. Multiple connection requests cannot be handled simultaneously by one BLE chip of the gateway.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) pair request can trigger connecting action automatically if the device is not connected. In this case, multiple pair requests can not be handled simultaneously.<br>Checks: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)   User needs to handle requests in serial, which is to wait for the response and then invoke the next connection request. Refer to sample code for details: https://github.com/CassiaNetworks/CassiaSDKGuide/blob/master/node_examples/connectDevices.js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)  If gateway(X2000/X1000/E1000) has two chips, two chips can handle connection requests from two devices in parallel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) use batch API to handle concurrent connection requests. Refer to sample code for details: https://github.com/CassiaNetworks/CassiaSDKGuide/blob/master/node_examples/acBatchMultipleByTimer.js |
| `incorrect mode` | Reason: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) When gateway is set to 'Pure Scan Mode', connection request to gateway will return this error.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) When gateway receives connection or pair request, the same device is in the middle of connecting or disconnecting.<br>Checks: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The scan mode in BLE paramaters of gateway settings is not pure scan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Connection request for the same device is not sent in parallel.|
| `operation not supported` | Reserved for future use. |
| `need pair operation` | Some devices require an operation for pairing after a successful connection. If a GATT function call happens prior to the pairing, the system will return this error. <br>From v2.0.3 “Need pair operation” will be placed the following 3 error code,<br>"ATT insufficient Authentication",<br>"ATT insufficient Authorization",<br>"ATT insufficient Encryption",<br>Depending on response message from device side, router will reply one of the above error.|
|`pair in process`| Reason: Pair request is processing. Need additional pair input to complete pair operation.<br>Checks: provide pair input such as passkey according previous pair return value (such as Passkey Input Expected, Passkey Display Expected, Numeric Comparison Expected, LE Legacy Pairing OOB Expected)|
|`connect failed`|Reason: gateway return this error immediately after connection established, due to switching to data channel failure.<br>Checks:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) reconnect device.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) specify retry parameter 'fail_retry_times=3' in connection API to reduce this error.|
|`ATT insufficient Authentication`|The attribute requires authentication before it can be read or written|
|`ATT insufficient Authorization`|The attribute requires authorization before it can be read or written|
|`ATT insufficient Encryption`|The Encryption Key Size used for encrypting this link is insufficient|
| `no resources` | Reason: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Concurrent connection numbers reaches to gateway limitation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Gateway does not have enough buffer resource.<br>Checks: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Concurrent connection numbers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Too many concurrent API requests, reduce the concurrent requests.  |
| `Service Not Found` | Couldn't find a Characteristic inside a Service. |
| `type not supported` | When Bypass scan was set up, the protocol type you specified is not supported by this firmware. |
| `please set bypass params first` | Bypass mode is enabled, but no bypass parameters have been set. |
| `failure` | An error for all other failures not specified yet. |
| `device not scan`|  Reason: Gateway is not able to scan the advertising packet from the device. <br>Checks:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Device MAC address and type (public/random) could be wrong, the default type value is public. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The default timeout value of connection API is 5000 (ms). Increase the timeout value according to device's advertising interval. It is recommeded to set to 10000 ms for 1 second adv interval, set to 20000 ms for longer adv interval.|
| `host disconnect`| manually disconnect device, will report in connection-state SSE reason field|
| `authenticate miss key`| crypt data failed using and existing key, will report in connection-state SSE reason field|
