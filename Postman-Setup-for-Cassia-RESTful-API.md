## What is Postman?
## Setting Up Postman for AC-Managed Cassia RESTful API
### Download Postman
[https://www.getpostman.com/downloads](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

For this guide, we are using: Postman Version 7.13.0

### Postman Initial Setup
Once Postman is finished installing, open the application.
A screen asking to create an account or sign in will appear. (It is optional to sign in or not.)

This is an example of a plain Postman workspace after you open the application for the first time:

### Request a Cassia AC RESTful API Access Token
At the top-left corner, there should be a "New" button.
Click on it and click on "Request".

<br>
A pop-up window may ask for you to save this request into a collection. Create a collection and save the request into it. 

This is an example of saving a Postman request into a collection called "Authorization":

A new tab should appear in the workspace. Change the default "GET" request type to "POST".
