The Cassia IoT Access Controller (AC) is a powerful IoT network management solution. It
provides RESTful APIs for the business to do data collection, positioning, and security policy
management, enabling the remote control of Cassia Bluetooth routers across the Internet.
You can operate your BLE devices using a set of RESTful APIs, via the Cassia AC and the
Cassia routers. Please see below figure for the Cassia RESTful APIs Working Diagram, using
X1000 as an example.
